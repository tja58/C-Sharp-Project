# QueueProblem
In this project we use queues to keep track of exercises that we have to do.

* Option 1
    * Add Exercise
        * The user is able to add exercises to the queue
* Option 2
    * Complete exercise
        * The user is able to mark the first exercise of the queue as complete and move onto the next exercise
* Option 3
    * Complete all exercises
        * This option allows the user to end the program once when they are finished with their workout.
