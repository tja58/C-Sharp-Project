# Queue Example

In this example we use a queue to add customers in line and keep track of the order. We create node in which we are able to keep track of people's first name and last initial.

## Program
In this we add people to the queue and serve two customers. When the customer is added to the queue they are placed at the back of the line. When we serve the customers the first person in the queue is removed.

## HairCut
In this file we create a class that stores the customers firstname and last initial of the customer. We also create a function to remove the first person from the queue.
