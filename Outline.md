# C# Fundamentals Tutorial


## I. Welcome

* Welcome this project we are going to be covering the basics of C# fundamentals. These fundamentals that are going to be covered should go over relatively intermediate topics. The topics covered have definitions, examples, and example problems. With the example problem given there is also a solution link in which you can compare your answers to.  
* For questions comments and concerns please reach out via email: [atk21009@byui.edu](mailto:atk21009@byui.edu)

## II. Queues
* In this section we go into details about queues and their uses and applications in real life. This document will cover the basics of queues, and show an example of a queue. There is also a queue example problem in which you are invited to try on your own. There is a link to the solution included so you can compare your answer.

  * Dequeue
  * Peek
  * Contain
  * Count
  * Clear

## III. Linked Lists
* In this section we into linked lists and their uses and functionality. Linked lists are elements of data stringed together so that they can be easily inserted and deleted from a list. Linked list order is not given by their physical placement in the memory. Rather the order of the data is directed from the elements inside the list that point to one another. A linked list consists of nodes that point to one another and gives the linked list order. 
* **<font size="4">[Terms](2-LinkedList.md#terms)</font>**
  * Head
  * Tail
  * Node
  * Next
  * Previous
  * Data

## IV. Trees
* In this section we go into the basics and uses of data trees. In which we are able to store information, organize information, and retrieve information quickly. Trees are a common way we are able to store information and have it organized for us. This allows for fast and easy retrieval of information that we store.
* **<font size="4">[Tree Types](3-Tree.md#trees-types)</font>**
  * General Tree
  * Binary Tree
  * Binary Search Tree
  * AVL Tree
  * Red-Black Tree
  * N-ary Tree
* **[Tree example](3-Tree.md#trees-example--phone-number)**
* **[Tree example problem](3-Tree.md#example-problem--football-roster)**
* **[Tree Problem Template](https://github.com/BYUI-CSE212-W23-01/final-project-atk21009/tree/main/C%23%20Files/ProblemTemplates/TreeProblemTemplate)**
