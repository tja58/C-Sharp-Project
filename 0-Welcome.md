# C# Data Structures Tutorial

 Welcome to the C# Data Structure Tutorial. Every beginner to advanced programmers should strive to better understand these topics.

## [I. Queues](1-Queue.md)
* In this section we go into details about queues and their uses and applications in real life. This document will cover the basics of queues, and show an example of a queue. There is also a queue example problem in which you are invited to try on your own. There is a link to the solution included so you can compare your answer.
* **[Queue example](1-Queue.md#queues-example--haircut-queue)**
* **[Queue example problem](1-Queue.md#queue-problem--exercise-queue)**
* **[Queue example problem - Solution](https://github.com/BYUI-CSE212-W23-01/final-project-atk21009/tree/main/C%23%20Files/Problems/QueueProblem)**


## [II. Linked List](2-LinkedList.md)
* In this section we into linked lists and their uses and functionality. Linked lists are elements of data stringed together so that they can be easily inserted and deleted from a list. Linked list order is not given by their physical placement in the memory. Rather the order of the data is directed from the elements inside the list that point to one another. A linked list consists of nodes that point to one another and gives the linked list order.

## [III. Tree](3-Tree.md)
* In this section we go into the basics and uses of data trees. In which we are able to store information, organize information, and retrieve information quickly. Trees are a common way we are able to store information and have it organized for us. This allows for fast and easy retrieval of information that we store.
